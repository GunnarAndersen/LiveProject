Avatar.cs - There is a user class which needed greater personalization. 
I created the avatar.cs class and I also made a function for it to use enums to select pictures

While it cannot be seen, there was also a "Contact" page, and a few other things, which had to be removed- I was tasked with removing those
and I did. 

A lot of the work that I did is copyrighted material so I cannot post it in its entirety, so I have included screenshots of my code. I have commented on what is happening in each respective screenshot.

codeScreenshot1 - I changed this so that it would return to the dashboard view if there is no name for the user.
codeScreenshot2 - This function stores chat messages into a database which is the user's mailbbox.
codeScreenshot3 - This function instantiates a new Manager of type ApplicationUser and it displays their first name and last initial in a chat Modal.
codeScreenshot4 - This setup the chat modal so that it displays correctly.
codeScreenshot5 - This is a view that shows the chat modal that I set up. In this case we changed it so that it will display the username of the user, this time, being, "fluffydog".
